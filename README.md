# A sequential Monte Carlo algorithm for data assimilation problems in ecology

This repository hosts the code, supplementary materials and figures used to write the manuscript. To be able to run the scripts in this repository, the following R-packages must be installed in R: `nimbleSMC`, `nimble`, `sparta` and `nimMCMCSMCupdates`. The later can be installed from the github repository [link](https://github.com/Peprah94/nimMCMCSMCupdates).

## Fitting models

The folders we describe below should contain the Rscipt and results from the analysis. However, some of the results files are relatively large, and could not be updated on GitHib. We have uploaded them to a [dropbox account](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/27ha5bb7zbb5djabxjdsp/h?rlkey=jhdut9lrdxapmg6r73ksm0dc0&dl=0).
